# WebRocky

## Summary 
WebRocky is a web-based client for the Xiaomi vacuums.

## Motivation
One of the reasons I started this project is that the Android based Mi Home and Roborock applications doesn't seem to work well on my Android phone. I experienced sudden battery drain issues, so I wanted to be able to control the vacuum from my desktop PC.
The other reason is to add some features I found missing in the app, such as being able to remember certain positions and zones on the map, or saving and restoring preset no-go zone and no-mop zone profiles.
